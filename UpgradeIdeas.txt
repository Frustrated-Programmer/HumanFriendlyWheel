Note: these are just ideas, depending on my time and how well this project goes, I may add them
(Ranked in likely hood of being added)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

design custom weight/trashcan images so they are copyright free.
let the user change the winning color and the losing colors
the wheel doesn't start out with a pointer.
the add list button GUI has a small issue, the weight input is higher by 1-2 px
add a button that hides the sidebar. (SHIFT+S maybe re-shows it)
add a checkbox to disable/enable pointer
maybe add settings that allow user to change text/background/border color of the objects
maybe add customization to the pointer
have the export button export a html/js file using exactly the barebones needed to recreate the wheel. (JSON export is missing things like sounds & pointer)
